# UPI-fraud-Detection-using-ML
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in Unified Payments Interface (UPI) systems using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to identify potentially malicious activities in real-time based on transaction patterns, user behavior, and anomaly detection techniques. 

Features:
Preprocessing and cleaning of UPI transaction data
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key fraud indicators
Feature engineering to extract behavioral and transactional features
Model training using various algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Neural Networks
Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Real-time prediction interface (optional: Flask/Streamlit)
Visualizations and insights from the dataset

Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Dataset:
Synthetic or anonymized UPI transaction dataset
Includes fields like transaction ID, amount, sender/receiver ID, timestamp, device ID, location, and fraud label
